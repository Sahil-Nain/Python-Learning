# **Lambda** arguments: Expression

A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined without a name using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are often used as a quick way to define simple, one-line functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions.

Here's the basic syntax for defining a lambda function:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

The arguments are the input arguments to the function, and the expression is a single expression that gets evaluated and returned as the output of the function.

For example, here's a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
```

This lambda function can be called just like any other function, for example:

```python
result = add(3, 4)  # result is 7
```

Lambda functions can also be used as arguments to other functions. For example, here's how you might use a lambda function to sort a list of tuples by the second element of each tuple:

```python
my_list = [(1, 2), (4, 1), (5, 6), (3, 4)]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

In this example, the sorted() function is called with a key argument that specifies a lambda function to extract the second element of each tuple. The resulting sorted list would be [(4, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)].
