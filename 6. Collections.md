# **Collections**: Counter, Namedtuple, OrderedDict, DefaultDict, Deque

In Python, the term "collections" refers to a group of data types that are used to store multiple values in a single variable. The built-in collections in Python include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, which we have already discussed. However, the collections module in Python also provides additional specialized data types that can be useful in certain situations. Here are a few examples:

deque: A double-ended queue that allows you to efficiently append and pop items from either end. Here's an example:

```python
from collections import deque

my_deque = deque([1, 2, 3])
my_deque.append(4)  # Add an item to the right end
my_deque.appendleft(0)  # Add an item to the left end
print(my_deque)  # Output: deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Counter: A dictionary subclass that counts the number of occurrences of each item in a list. Here's an example:

```python
from collections import Counter

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 1]
my_counter = Counter(my_list)
print(my_counter)  # Output: Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1})
```

defaultdict: A dictionary subclass that provides a default value for keys that don't exist. Here's an example:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

my_dict = defaultdict(int)
my_dict['a'] = 1
my_dict['b'] = 2
print(my_dict['a'])  # Output: 1
print(my_dict['c'])  # Output: 0 (default value for int type is 0)
```

namedtuple: A factory function that creates a new subclass of tuple with named fields. This can be useful for creating lightweight, immutable objects. Here's an example:

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Person = namedtuple('Person', ['name', 'age', 'gender'])
p = Person(name='Alice', age=25, gender='female')
print(p.name)  # Output: 'Alice'
print(p.age)  # Output: 25
```

These are just a few examples of the specialized data types provided by the collections module in Python.
