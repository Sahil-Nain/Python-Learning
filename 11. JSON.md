# **JSON**

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format. It's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. The JSON format is widely used for exchanging data between web applications and APIs, and it's supported in many programming languages including Python.

In Python, you can use the built-in json module to work with JSON data. The json module provides two methods, dumps() and loads(), for encoding and decoding JSON data, respectively.

Here's an example of how to use the json module to encode a Python dictionary into a JSON string:
```python
import json

data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

json_string = json.dumps(data)
print(json_string)
```

Output:
```python
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```
In this example, we imported the json module and created a Python dictionary called data that contains some data. We then used the dumps() method of the json module to encode the data dictionary into a JSON string, which we stored in the json_string variable. Finally, we printed the json_string variable to the console.

Here's an example of how to use the json module to decode a JSON string into a Python dictionary:
```python
import json

json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'

data = json.loads(json_string)
print(data)
```
Output:
```python
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
In this example, we imported the json module and created a string variable called json_string that contains some JSON data. We then used the loads() method of the json module to decode the json_string into a Python dictionary, which we stored in the data variable. Finally, we printed the data variable to the console.

The json module also provides methods for encoding and decoding JSON data from files. Here's an example of how to use the dump() and load() methods to write and read a Python dictionary to and from a JSON file:
```python
import json

data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Writing JSON data to a file
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Reading JSON data from a file
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(data)
```
Output:
```python
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
n this example, we created a Python dictionary called data. We then used the dump() method of the json module to write the data dictionary to a JSON file called data.json. We used the load() method of the json module to read the JSON data from the data.json file back into a Python dictionary, which we stored in the data variable. Finally, we printed the data variable to the console.

That's the basics of using the json module in Python! If you want to learn more, there are plenty of additional features and options available in the json module documentation.

## Other Examples from the video:
```python
# Converting Python dict. into Json Format:
import json

person = {"name": "john", "age": 30, "city": "New York", "haschildern": False, "titles": ["emgineer", "Programmer"]}

# Using indent and sort_keys for better readability.

personJSON = json.dumps(person, indent=4, sort_keys = True)
print(personJSON)

with open('person.json', 'w') as file:
  json.dump(person, file, indent = 4, sort_keys = True) # This code will create a person.json file and dump all of your contents into it.
```
The code will conver your Python dictionary into JSON format and the result should look something like this:
```
{
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "haschildern": false,
    "name": "john",
    "titles": [
        "emgineer",
        "Programmer"
    ]
}
```
The above Process is called *Encoding*.

But if you want to Convert it back to a python object, The process is called *Decoding*. To convert Above code back to python we can use.
```python
person = json.loads(personJSON)
print(person)
```
