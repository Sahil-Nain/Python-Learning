# **Dictonary**: Key-Value Pairs, Unordered, Mutable...

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value. In Python, dictionaries are denoted by curly braces { }, and each key-value pair is separated by a colon (:).

Here's an example of a dictionary:

```python
my_dict = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

In this example, the keys are 'apple', 'banana', and 'orange', and the corresponding values are 3, 2, and 1.

You can access the value associated with a key in a dictionary using the square bracket notation:

```python
print(my_dict['apple']) # Output: 3
```

You can also add or update key-value pairs in a dictionary using the same square bracket notation:

```python
my_dict['pear'] = 4 # Add a new key-value pair
my_dict['apple'] = 5 # Update the value associated with an existing key
```

You can remove a key-value pair from a dictionary using the del keyword:

```python
del my_dict['orange'] # Remove the key-value pair for 'orange'
```

You can iterate over the keys in a dictionary using a for loop:

```python
for key in my_dict:
print(key)
```

The above code will output:

```python
#output
apple
banana
pear
```

You can also iterate over the key-value pairs using the .items() method:

```python
for key, value in my_dict.items():
print(key, value)
```

This will output:
```python
apple 5
banana 2
pear 4
```

Finally, you can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the in keyword:

```python
if 'apple' in my_dict:
print('The value for "apple" is:', my_dict['apple'])
```
