# Learn Python

This repository contains a collection of Python lessons for beginners. The lessons cover the basics of Python programming, including data types, control structures, functions, modules, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lessons, you should have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using Python 3.x, but the lessons should also work with Python 2.x.

In addition to Python, you may want to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Python code. Some popular IDEs for Python include PyCharm, VS Code, and Spyder.
