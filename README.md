## Prerequisites

Before starting the lessons, you should have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using Python 3.x, but the lessons should also work with Python 2.x.

In addition to Python, you may want to use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Python code. Some popular IDEs for Python include PyCharm, VS Code, and Spyder.

## Lesson Structure

The lessons are organized into several sections, each covering a specific topic. Each section includes one or more lessons, along with exercises to help reinforce your understanding of the material.
