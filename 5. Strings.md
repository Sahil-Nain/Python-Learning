# **Strings** : Ordered, Immutable, Text Representation

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. Strings can be created using either single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("..."). Here are some examples:

```python
my_string1 = 'Hello, world!'
my_string2 = "I'm learning Python."
```

You can access individual characters in a string using indexing. In Python, indexing starts at 0. For example:

```python
my_string = 'Hello, world!'
print(my_string[0])  # Output: 'H'
print(my_string[1])  # Output: 'e'
print(my_string[7])  # Output: 'w'
```

You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string:

```python
my_string = 'Hello, world!'
print(my_string[-1])  # Output: '!'
print(my_string[-2])  # Output: 'd'
print(my_string[-8])  # Output: ' '
```

You can extract a substring from a string using slicing. Slicing uses the syntax [start:end], where start is the index of the first character to include, and end is the index of the first character to exclude. For example:

```python
my_string = 'Hello, world!'
print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: 'Hello'
print(my_string[7:])  # Output: 'world!'
```

You can concatenate two or more strings using the + operator:

```python
my_string = 'ha'
laugh = my_string * 3
print(laugh)  # Output: 'hahaha'
```

Strings are immutable, which means that you cannot change the characters in a string once it has been created. However, you can create a new string that is a modified version of an existing string.

There are many built-in functions and methods for working with strings in Python. Here are a few examples:

```python
my_string = 'Hello, world!'
print(len(my_string))  # Output: 13
print(my_string.upper())  # Output: 'HELLO, WORLD!'
print(my_string.lower())  # Output: 'hello, world!'
print(my_string.startswith('Hello'))  # Output: True
print(my_string.endswith('world!'))  # Output: True
print(my_string.replace('world', 'Python'))  # Output: 'Hello, Python!'
```
