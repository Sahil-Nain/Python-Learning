# **Itertolls**: Product, Permutations, Combinations, Accumulate, Groupby and Infinite Iterators

The itertools module is a Python standard library module that provides a collection of functions for working with iterators, which are objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Here are a few examples of how you can use itertools:

count(): Returns an iterator that generates an infinite sequence of numbers starting from a given value.

```python
import itertools

for i in itertools.count(1, 2):
    if i > 10:
        break
    print(i)
```

Output:
```python
1
3
5
7
9
```

cycle(): Returns an iterator that repeatedly cycles through a sequence of values.

```python
import itertools

count = 0
for i in itertools.cycle('ABC'):
    if count > 6:
        break
    print(i)
    count += 1
```
Output:

```python
A
B
C
A
B
C
A
```
chain(): Combines multiple iterators into a single iterator that returns all the elements from each of the input iterators in order.

```python
import itertools

iter1 = [1, 2, 3]
iter2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for i in itertools.chain(iter1, iter2):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```python
1
2
3
a
b
c
```

product(): Returns an iterator that generates the Cartesian product of multiple input iterables.

```python
import itertools

iter1 = [1, 2]
iter2 = ['a', 'b']
for i in itertools.product(iter1, iter2):
    print(i)
```
Output:
```python
(1, 'a')
(1, 'b')
(2, 'a')
(2, 'b')
```

These are just a few examples of the functions available in the itertools module. There are many more functions available, such as permutations(), combinations(), and groupby(), which can be useful for various tasks involving iterators. You should try them out by yourself.
