# **logging** in Python

Logging is a way of recording events that occur while your program is running. It's useful for understanding what's happening in your code and debugging issues. Python has a built-in logging module that makes it easy to add logging to your programs.

Here's a simple example:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
logging.critical('This is a critical message')
```

In this example, we import the logging module and set the logging level to DEBUG using basicConfig. This means that all log messages with a level of DEBUG or higher will be printed to the console.

We then use the debug, info, warning, error, and critical methods to log messages at different levels. Each method takes a string argument that represents the message to be logged.

When you run this program, you should see output like this:

```python
DEBUG:root:This is a debug message
INFO:root:This is an info message
WARNING:root:This is a warning message
ERROR:root:This is an error message
CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message
```

The first line of each message shows the log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL). The root part of the message refers to the root logger, which is the parent logger that all other loggers inherit from.

You can customize the logging output format and destination using different logging handlers. For example, you can send log messages to a file, a database, or a remote server. The basicConfig method accepts various keyword arguments that allow you to configure the logging output. You can find more information about configuring logging in Python in the [official documentation:](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
