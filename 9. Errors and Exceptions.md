# \*\*Errors and Exceptions

In Python, errors occur when the code is syntactically incorrect or when the interpreter cannot execute the code.

Syntax Error:
Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language. These errors are caught by the interpreter during the parsing phase and prevent the code from executing. On the other hand, exceptions occur during the runtime of the code and are caused by things like division by zero, accessing an undefined variable, etc. For example:

```python
# Syntax error example.
a = 5
print(a)) # A sinple syntax error could be missing or using too many brackets in a statement.

#output: SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Exception:
Exceptions occur when the code is syntactically correct, but there is a runtime error. Exceptions are raised by the interpreter when an error is encountered during the execution of the code. For example:

```python
# Exception example
a = 5 + '10'  #you can't add a string and a number.

# Output
# TypeEroor: unsupported operator type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

The difference between Syntax Errors and Exceptions:

Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language. These errors are caught by the interpreter during the parsing phase and prevent the code from executing. On the other hand, exceptions occur during the runtime of the code and are caused by things like division by zero, accessing an undefined variable, etc.

The most common built-in exceptions:

Python has many built-in exceptions that can be raised by the interpreter or by the user. Some of the most common built-in exceptions are:

- AttributeError: Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.
- ValueError: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
- IndexError: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
- KeyError: Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.
- TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.

Raising and handling exceptions:
You can raise exceptions in your code using the raise statement. The raise statement takes an exception class or an instance of an exception class as its argument. Here's an example:

```python
x = -1
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("x cannot be negative")
```

You can handle exceptions in your code using the try and except statements. The try statement is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception. The except statement is used to handle the exception that is raised. Here's an example:

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    y = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
else:
    print("The result is:", y)
finally:
    print("Thank you for using the program")
```

Defining your own exceptions:
You can define your own exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. Here's an example:

```python
class MyException(Exception):
    pass

raise MyException("This is my custom exception")
```

In this example, we've created a new exception class called MyException that inherits from the built-in Exception class. We can raise this exception in our code just like any other exception.
