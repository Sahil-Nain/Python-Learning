# **Sets**: Unodered, mutable, no duplicates

A set is another built-in data type in Python that is used to store a collection of unique items. In a set, each item must be unique, and the items themselves are not stored in any particular order.

In Python, sets are denoted by curly braces { }, and the items are separated by commas. Here's an example:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

In this example, my_set contains the unique integers from 1 to 5. Note that the items are not stored in any particular order.

You can add items to a set using the .add() method:

```python
my_set.add(6)
```

You can remove items from a set using the .remove() method:

```python
my_set.remove(3)
```

You can check if an item is in a set using the in keyword:

```python
if 2 in my_set:
print('2 is in the set!')
```

You can iterate over the items in a set using a for loop:

```python
for item in my_set:
print(item)
```

You can perform various operations on sets, such as union, intersection, and difference. Here are some examples:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}

# Union

union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Intersection

intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set) # Output: {2, 3}

# Difference

difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set) # Output: {1}
```
